## Progress
- I am just learning everything. UE5, UE5's C++, Blender, playing guitar /etc .

## Goals
In the near future: to create fearless, harshly criticized games, using all kinds of humor, almost as an act of rebellion with copylefted FOSS licenses.
In the distant future: to make story-driven AA/AAA games in the style of RDR, The Witcher, Uncharted, and Mafia (except 3!), in short:
*To make art.* `make art -j$(nproc) # HAHAHAHA SOO FUNNY`

## Builted Games
*There is only one game :( bcz like i said, i am still learning*
### Russian Roulette
- CLI-BASED Game
- Runs both on GNU/Linux and dickdows
- It selects a random number between 0 and 10
- If you get it true, you are alive but if you dont't,
- It will cause **memory leak** and will delete every file.

## About Other [PiGames](https://github.com/PiGames)
Well, i noticed them after using this PiGames name. I think they are a dead game stuido, their last commits were years ago. And they are using Pig, i am using Pi itself. So there should not be any copyright issues.
